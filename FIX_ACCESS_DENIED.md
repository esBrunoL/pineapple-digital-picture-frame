## üö® **The Issue:**
You're getting "Access Denied" when trying to access photos from your `tropical-repo` S3 bucket.

## üîß **Quick Fix Steps:**

### **Step 1: Check Block Public Access Settings**

2. **Click on `tropical-repo` bucket**
3. **Go to "Permissions" tab**
4. **Click "Edit" on "Block public access (bucket settings)"**
5. **UNCHECK ALL 4 boxes:**
   - ‚ùå Block public access to buckets and objects granted through new access control lists (ACLs)
   - ‚ùå Block public access to buckets and objects granted through any access control lists (ACLs)  
   - ‚ùå Block public access to buckets and objects granted through new public bucket or access point policies
   - ‚ùå Block public access to buckets and objects granted through any public bucket or access point policies
6. **Click "Save changes"**
7. **Type "confirm" when prompted**

### **Step 2: Update Bucket Policy**
1. **Still in "Permissions" tab**
2. **Scroll to "Bucket policy"**
3. **Click "Edit"**
4. **Replace with this EXACT policy:**

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::tropical-repo/pineapple-frame-images/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

5. **Click "Save changes"**

### **Step 3: Check Object ACLs** (if still having issues)
1. **Go to "Objects" tab in your bucket**
2. **Click on `pineapple-frame-images/` folder**
3. **Select one of your uploaded photos**
4. **Click "Actions" ‚Üí "Make public using ACL"**
5. **Click "Make public"**

### **Step 4: Test Access**
Try accessing this URL in your browser (replace with your actual photo name):
```
https://tropical-repo.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/pineapple-frame-images/pineapple-photo-01.jpg
```

## üéØ **Common Issues & Solutions:**

### **Issue**: "Block public access" keeps getting enabled
- **Solution**: Make sure you're the bucket owner and have admin permissions

### **Issue**: Policy won't save
- **Solution**: Copy the JSON exactly as shown above, ensure proper bucket name

### **Issue**: Still getting Access Denied after policy update
- **Solution**: Wait 5-10 minutes for AWS changes to propagate, then test again

## ‚úÖ **Success Check:**
Once fixed, you should be able to:
1. ‚úÖ View photos directly in browser via S3 URLs
2. ‚úÖ See your personal photos in the pineapple picture frame app
3. ‚úÖ No more "Access Denied" errors

## üÜò **Still Having Issues?**
If you're still getting Access Denied:
1. **Double-check** all 4 "Block public access" boxes are UNCHECKED
2. **Verify** the bucket policy matches exactly (copy-paste recommended)
3. **Wait 5-10 minutes** for AWS changes to take effect
4. **Try incognito/private browser** to test without cache
